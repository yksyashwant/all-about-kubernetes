# Kubernetes Objects and API Versions

## Kubernetes Objects

Kubernetes objects are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. They represent the state of your cluster and include information about:

- **What containers are running**
- **Which resources they can use**
- **How they behave**

Common Kubernetes objects include:

1. **Pod**: The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object. A pod represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster.
2. **Service**: An abstraction that defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them.
3. **Deployment**: Provides declarative updates to applications. It describes the desired state and manages the deployment of pods.
4. **ReplicaSet**: Ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.
5. **ConfigMap**: Allows you to decouple configuration artifacts from image content to keep containerized applications portable.
6. **Secret**: Used to store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and ssh keys.

## API Versions

Kubernetes uses API versions to evolve its API while maintaining compatibility. The API version indicates the maturity and stability of a resource. Common API version stages include:

1. **alpha**: Early stage, may change significantly. Not recommended for production use.
2. **beta**: More stable than alpha, but still may change. Features are well-tested and enabled by default.
3. **stable**: Fully stable and mature. Ready for production use.

### Examples of API Versions:

- **v1**: Indicates the first stable release of a resource.
- **v1beta1**: Indicates a beta release that is more stable than alpha but may still change.
- **v1alpha1**: Indicates an alpha release with potential significant changes in the future.

### How to Specify API Versions:

When defining Kubernetes objects, you must specify the `apiVersion` field in the YAML or JSON configuration file. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
```

In this example, `apiVersion: v1` specifies that the Pod resource is using the stable v1 API version.

# Kubernetes Deployment

## What is a Kubernetes Deployment?

- A Kubernetes Deployment is a resource object in Kubernetes that provides declarative updates to applications.
- It describes the desired state for your application and manages the deployment and scaling of pods.
- Deployments make it easy to roll out updates to applications and ensure that the desired number of pod replicas are running at any given time.

## Key Features

1. **Declarative Updates**: Specify the desired state of your application, and Kubernetes will manage the changes to bring the current state to the desired state.
2. **Scaling**: Easily scale up or down the number of pod replicas.
3. **Rollouts**: Perform rolling updates to update pods without downtime.
4. **Rollbacks**: Revert back to a previous state if something goes wrong during a rollout.
5. **Self-Healing**: Automatically replaces failed or unhealthy pods.

## Components of a Deployment

1. **Selector**: Defines how to identify the pods that belong to the deployment.
2. **Template**: Specifies the desired state for the pods, including the container image, environment variables, and other configurations.
3. **Replicas**: Defines the number of pod replicas to run.


## Lab Session 4: Deployments

### Objectives:
- Understand the concept of deployments in Kubernetes.
- Learn how to create and manage deployments.

Here is an example of a Kubernetes Deployment using a declarative YAML format:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### Explanation:

- **apiVersion**: Specifies the API version for the deployment. For Deployments, it's usually `apps/v1`.
- **kind**: Specifies the type of resource. In this case, it's a `Deployment`.
- **metadata**: Provides metadata about the deployment, including the `name` and `labels`.
- **spec**: The specification of the deployment.
  - **replicas**: Defines the number of pod replicas to run.
  - **selector**: Defines how the deployment finds which Pods to manage based on labels.
    - **matchLabels**: Specifies the label selector to match the Pods.
  - **template**: Describes the Pods that will be created by the deployment.
    - **metadata**: Specifies the labels for the Pods.
    - **spec**: Defines the container specifications for the Pods.
      - **containers**: Specifies the list of containers in the Pod.
        - **name**: The name of the container.
        - **image**: The container image to run.
        - **ports**: The ports that the container will expose.

### Applying the Deployment:

1. Save the above YAML content to a file named `nginx-deployment.yaml`.
2. Apply the deployment using `kubectl`:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
   ```

### Verifying the Deployment:

- Check the status of the deployment:

  ```bash
  kubectl get deployments
  ```

- Describe the deployment to see detailed information:

  ```bash
  kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment
  ```

- List the Pods created by the deployment:

  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

### Updating the Deployment:

To update the deployment, you can modify the `nginx-deployment.yaml` file. For example, change the image version:

```yaml
image: nginx:1.14.2
```

Then, apply the changes:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
```
To delete a Kubernetes deployment, you can use the `kubectl delete` command. Here is how you can delete the `nginx-deployment` we created earlier.

1. **Delete the Deployment using `kubectl`**:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete -f nginx-deployment.yaml
   ```

   This command will delete the deployment defined in the `nginx-deployment.yaml` file.

2. **Alternatively, Delete the Deployment by Name**:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete deployment nginx-deployment
   ```

   This command will delete the deployment with the name `nginx-deployment`.

3. **Verify the Deletion**:

   ```bash
   kubectl get deployments
   ```

## Lab Session 5: Updating and Rolling Back Deployments

### Objectives:
- Learn how to update and roll back deployments in Kubernetes.
- Understand deployment history and rollback features.

### Steps:

1. **Update the Deployment:**
   - Update the `nginx-deployment.yaml` file with a new image version:
     ```yaml
     image: nginx:1.17.0
     ```
   - Apply the update:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
     ```

2. **Check Deployment History:**
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
   ```

3. **Rollback to a Previous Revision:**
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment
   ```

4. **Verify Rollback:**
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
   kubectl get pods
   ```
