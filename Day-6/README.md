### What are Kubernetes Services?

- In Kubernetes, Services are an abstraction layer that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.
- They enable network access to a set of Pods, providing a stable endpoint for communication within the Kubernetes cluster.

### Types of Kubernetes Services:

1. **ClusterIP**:
   - Exposes the Service on an internal IP address accessible only within the cluster.
   - Default type when not specified explicitly.

2. **NodePort**:
   - Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port.
   - Makes the Service accessible from outside the cluster using `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`.

3. **LoadBalancer**:
   - Creates an external load balancer in the cloud provider's network (if supported).
   - Routes external traffic to the Service.

4. **ExternalName**:
   - Maps a Service to a DNS name.
   - Used for integrating with external services via DNS.

### What is ClusterIP?

- **ClusterIP** is the default Kubernetes Service type.
- It assigns a stable IP address to the Service within the cluster.
- The Service is accessible only from within the Kubernetes cluster.

### Lab Session: ClusterIP

#### Objectives:
- Learn how to create a Kubernetes Service of type ClusterIP.

#### Steps:

1. **Create a Deployment:**
   - Create a deployment YAML file, e.g., `nginx-deployment.yaml`, to deploy a sample application (e.g., Nginx).
   - Apply the deployment:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
     ```

2. **Create a ClusterIP Service YAML:**
   - Create a file named `nginx-service.yaml` with the following content:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Service
     metadata:
       name: nginx-service
     spec:
       type: ClusterIP
       selector:
         app: nginx
       ports:
         - protocol: TCP
           port: 80
           targetPort: 80
     ```

3. **Apply the ClusterIP Service:**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
   ```

4. **Verify Service Creation:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get services
   ```

5. **Access the Service Within the Cluster:**
   - Use the ClusterIP to access the deployed application:
     ```bash
     curl http://nginx-service:80
     ```
# What is Node Port 
- A **NodePort** is a type of Kubernetes Service that exposes a service on a specific port on each Node in the cluster, making it accessible from outside the cluster.
- This allows external traffic to access the service running inside the Kubernetes cluster.

### Key Concepts

- **NodePort Range**: By default, NodePort values range between 30000 and 32767.
- **Cluster IP**: NodePort services also get a ClusterIP, which allows them to be accessed from within the cluster.

### How NodePort Works

1. **Service Definition**: When you define a service with a `type: NodePort`, Kubernetes allocates a port from the NodePort range (or you can specify one).
2. **Node Exposure**: Kubernetes makes the service accessible on that port across all nodes in the cluster.
3. **External Access**: You can access the service from outside the cluster by sending a request to any Node's IP address at the allocated NodePort.

### Lab Session: NodePort

#### Objectives:
- Learn how to create a Kubernetes Service of type NodePort.

#### Steps:

1. **Create a NodePort Service YAML:**
   - Create a file named `nginx-nodeport-service.yaml` with the following content:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service
  namespace: dev
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 32500
  type: NodePort

```

2. **Apply the NodePort Service:**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f nginx-nodeport-service.yaml
   ```

3. **Verify Service Creation:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get services
   ```

4. **Access the Service Using NodePort:**
   - Get the NodePort allocated (let's assume `NodePort: 30080`):
   ```bash
      kubectl get services my-app-service
   ```
   - Access the service from outside the cluster using `<NodeIP>:30080`.

# LoadBalancer
- In Kubernetes, a **LoadBalancer** is a type of Service that automatically provisions and manages an external load balancer for routing external traffic to the pods within the cluster.
- This type of service abstracts the complexity of external load balancing and integrates it seamlessly with Kubernetes.

### Key Concepts

- **External Load Balancer**: A LoadBalancer service typically provisions an external load balancer from the cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
- **Automatic Configuration**: The service is automatically configured to distribute traffic to the appropriate pods.
- **External Access**: Provides a stable IP address (or DNS name) for accessing the service from outside the cluster.

### How LoadBalancer Works

1. **Service Definition**: When you define a service with `type: LoadBalancer`, Kubernetes provisions an external load balancer through the cloud provider.
2. **Traffic Routing**: The external load balancer routes incoming traffic to the service, which then forwards the traffic to the appropriate pods based on the service's selector.
3. **Stable Endpoint**: The external load balancer provides a stable IP address or DNS name for accessing the service.

### Lab Session: Load Balancer

#### Objectives:
- Learn how to create a Kubernetes Service of type LoadBalancer.

#### Steps:

1. **Create a LoadBalancer Service YAML:**
   - Create a file named `nginx-loadbalancer-service.yaml` with the following content:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service
  namespace: dev
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-subnets: subnet-028dc499437b2b83f,subnet-0f349567f5fec79de
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer

```

2. **Apply the LoadBalancer Service:**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f nginx-loadbalancer-service.yaml
   ```

3. **Verify Service Creation:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get services
   ```

4. **Get the External IP Address (if applicable):**
   - Depending on your cloud provider, the external IP will be allocated.
   - Get the external IP using:
   ```bash
    kubectl get services my-app-service
    ```

5. **Access the Service via Load Balancer:**
   - Use the external IP to access the deployed application.
